<h2> üéì My Senior Capstone</h2>
  My group and I are developing a Sim Firefighting experience. The player takes role as the leader or a firefighting squad in charge of preventing forest fires. Our team has worked hard to get to the current state of the game. Here is a breakdown:

  Currently we have the following in place:
  -  Basic spawn system
  -  Fire spread algorithm
  -  Houdini generated trees and terrain
  -  Mockup UI
  -  Weather simulation for entire map

  What we plan to have as an mvp:
  -  Interactive UI
  -  Playable fire fighter which puts out fires in proximity
  -  Compartalized weather system for added effect
  -  Win/Loss condition

  Some images of progress:
