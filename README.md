## 🧬 Beyond the Code
  If you're curious about who I am and where I’ve been, I’ve left a little bit about my journey here. While the code someone writes is important, I believe that everyone’s backstory deserves some attention too.
  
  I grew up in a small town called Jewell, Oregon—a quiet place known for its farms, animals, and, well… not much else. It was peaceful, full of fresh air, and had its own charm. But as a die-hard computer enthusiast, it wasn’t the easiest environment. Being one of the   few people in the area passionate about computer science made it hard to find like-minded friends.
  
  This isn’t meant to be a sob story—just an honest look at what shaped me. The countless hours I spent alone with my computer actually worked to my advantage. I built a strong work ethic (and serious computer stamina), learning to push myself without external
  encouragement. It gave me perspective: in the real world, success often comes down to you—your determination, your effort.
  
  Fast forward to today, and my love for computers and learning is as strong as ever. Even before finishing college, I landed a career at Reynolds & Reynolds, where I get to work alongside an amazing team. Looking back, it’s clear that every experience, even the
  challenging ones, plays a role in shaping us into people capable of achieving incredible things.

## 🎓 My Senior Capstone
  You made it this far, nice work! I would like to share with you what my group and I have been developing during out capstone class. We and I are developing a Sim Firefighting experience. The player takes role as the leader or a firefighting squad in charge of
  preventing forest fires. Our team has worked hard to get to the current state of the game. We have changed our course slightly over the development of the game. Here is a breakdown:
  <br></br>
  
  #### Currently we have the following in place: 
  -  Fire spread algorithm
  -  Playable helicopter which can put out fires
  -  Water tower to allow the player to refill on water
  -  Houdini generated trees and terrain
  -  UI Displaying game stats
  -  Weather simulation for entire map

  #### What we plan to have as an mvp:
  -  A score system that will count up as the game progresses
  -  A simple loss condition if too many of the trees are burned
  -  A game over screen that allows previous games to be ranked

## 🛠 My New Personal Project:
  After working on the Sim Firefighter project, I have found out that I really enjoy creating video games in Unreal Engine. So much so that it pushed me to start another side project of my own. This new game allows the player to fly a spaceship, shoot asteroids, and
  eventually be able to upgrade their equipment. 

  NOTE: I currently do not have a repository setup for this file. Unreal Engine projects are rather large and I do not plan on releasing this project for free publicly.
  
  #### Currently I have the following in place:
  -  A spaceship the player can fly around
  -  A spawn system that dynamically spawn asteroids
  -  A simple UI that keeps track of the number of asteroids
  -  Cool visual effects and some audio

  #### Near future additions:
  -  A dynamic health system for both the player and asteroids. This system will use mass and speed to determine damage/health
  -  A leveling system that allows the player to upgrade their ship (This will follow rogue like systems)
  -  A single enemy ship
  -  A main menu and pause menu for simple user configurations
