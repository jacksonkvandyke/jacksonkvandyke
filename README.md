## üéì My Senior Capstone
  My group and I are developing a Sim Firefighting experience. The player takes role as the leader or a firefighting squad in charge of preventing forest fires. Our team has worked hard to get to the current state of the game. We have changed our course slightly over   
  the development of the game. Here is a breakdown:
  <br></br>
  
  #### Currently we have the following in place: 
  -  Fire spread algorithm
  -  Playable helicopter which can put out fires
  -  Water tower to allow the player to refill on water
  -  Houdini generated trees and terrain
  -  UI Displaying game stats
  -  Weather simulation for entire map

  #### What we plan to have as an mvp:
  -  A score system that will count up as the game progresses
  -  A simple loss condition if too many of the trees are burned
  -  A game over screen that allows previous games to be ranked

  #### Some images of progress:
