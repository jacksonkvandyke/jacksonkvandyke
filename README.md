## üéì My Senior Capstone
  My group and I are developing a Sim Firefighting experience. The player takes role as the leader or a firefighting squad in charge of preventing forest fires. Our team has worked hard to get to the current state of the game. We have changed our course slightly over   
  the development of the game. Here is a breakdown:
  <br></br>
  
  #### Currently we have the following in place: 
  -  Fire spread algorithm
  -  Playable helicopter which can put out fires
  -  Water tower to allow the player to refill on water
  -  Houdini generated trees and terrain
  -  UI Displaying game stats
  -  Weather simulation for entire map

  #### What we plan to have as an mvp:
  -  A score system that will count up as the game progresses
  -  A simple loss condition if too many of the trees are burned
  -  A game over screen that allows previous games to be ranked

## üõ† My New Personal Project:
  After working on the Sim Firefighter project, I have found out that I really enjoy creating video games in Unreal Engine. So much so that it pushed me to start another side project of my own. This new game allows the player to fly a spaceship, shoot asteroids, and
  eventually be able to upgrade their equipment. 

  NOTE: I currently do not have a repository setup for this file. Unreal Engine projects are rather large and I do not plan on releasing this project for free publicly.
  
  #### Currently I have the following in place:
  -  A spaceship the player can fly around
  -  A spawn system that dynamically spawn asteroids
  -  A simple UI that keeps track of the number of asteroids
  -  Cool visual effects and some audio

  #### Near future additions:
  -  A dynamic health system for both the player and asteroids. This system will use mass and speed to determine damage/health
  -  A leveling system that allows the player to upgrade their ship (This will follow rogue like systems)
  -  A single enemy ship
  -  A main menu and pause menu for simple user configurations
